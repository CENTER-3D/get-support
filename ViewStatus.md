# Viewing cloud status
{: #viewing-cloud-status}

The Status page is the central place to find all unplanned incidents, planned maintenance, announcements, and security bulletin notifications about key events that affect the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform, infrastructure, and major services.
{:shortdesc}

To view key events that are specifically affecting your account, go to the [Notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/user/notifications) page. You can easily update your preferences there.
{: note}

To view the status page, use the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Support**.  
2. From the Today's notifications widget, click **View all**, then click **View cloud status**. Or, you can access the page directly at [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} - Status](https://cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=status){: external}.
3. When you land on the page, you can view **Ongoing events**, such as confirmed incidents, incidents under investigation or the status of all IBM Cloud resources.
    * To get more information about an incident, click each component in the table. You can check the incident's location, start time and when it was last updated. If you are experiencing any issue with an item, you can report that by clicking the **Report impact** icon.
4. On the upper-left side of the page, you can view planned maintenance, security bulletins, announcements, and history in the side navigation pane.
    * Click **Planned maintenance** to see any scheduled upcoming maintenance. 
    * Click **Security bulletins** to view a list of security bulletins that might affect various {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services, infrastructure, or the platform.
    * Click **Announcements** to view a list of announcements that might be of general interest to you. 
    * Click **History** to view a list of completed events from the last 30 days. 
5. You can filter these lists by selecting specific locations, components, types of ongoing events, or by using keyword searches. If you click each item, you can get more details on what changes and why, and how that change impacts the environment.

For more information about the type of email notifications you can receive based on your account type, see [Setting email preferences](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-email-prefs). 

You can build URL search values by using query parameters from outside the console. For more information, see [Advanced status search](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-adv-search).

## Viewing Infrastructure notifications
{: viewing-infrastructure}


Infrastructure notifications are now hosted on the [Notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/notifications) page. You can still view planned and unplanned events, maintenance, and announcements that might be impacting your account. 

<!--To learn more about the unified notifications experience, see [Viewing notifications](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-viewing-notifications).--> 

## Subscribing to an RSS feed
{: #subscribing-rss-feed}

You receive alerts of any notifications by subscribing to the RSS feed for the Status page. This approach provides a way for you to get updates without having to regularly go to the Status page. Ongoing incidents or planned maintenance windows that impact a finite set of accounts do not display on the Status page. 

To subscribe, follow these steps:

1. Access your favorite RSS readers. Many browsers have built-in RSS capabilities or extensions available. Several third-party RSS reader products are also available. 
1. Use your reader to subscribe to the feed with one of the following methods:
    * Drag the RSS icon ![RSS-24px](../icons/RSS-24px.svg) into your RSS reader.
    * Right-click the RSS icon, select **Copy link address**, and paste the URL into your RSS reader.

For more information, see your reader's **Help** section.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} typically has approximately 50 updates per month.
