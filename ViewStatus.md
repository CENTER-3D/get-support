# Viewing cloud status

The Status page is the central place to find all unplanned incidents, planned maintenance, announcements, and security bulletin notifications about key events that affect the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} platform, infrastructure, and major services.

Incident notifications are regularly updated until they're resolved.

## Viewing Infrastructure notifications
{: viewing-infrastructure}


Infrastructure notifications are now hosted on the [Notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/notifications) page. You can still view planned and unplanned events, maintenance, and announcements that might be impacting your account. 

To learn more about the unified notifications experience, see [Viewing notifications](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-viewing-notifications). 

## Subscribing to an RSS feed
{: #subscribing-rss-feed}

You receive alerts of any notifications by subscribing to the RSS feed for the Status page. This approach provides a way for you to get updates without having to regularly go to the Status page.

To subscribe, follow these steps:

1. Access your favorite RSS readers. Many browsers have built-in RSS capabilities or extensions available. Several third-party RSS reader offerings are also available. 
1. Use your reader to subscribe to the feed with one of the following methods:
    * Drag the RSS icon ![RSS-24px](../icons/RSS-24px.svg) into your RSS reader.
    * Right-click the RSS icon, select **Copy link address**, and paste the URL into your RSS reader.

For more information, see your reader's **Help** section.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} typically has approximately 50 updates per month.
