# Case severity and initial response times
{: #support-case-severity}

How quickly your support cases are addressed depends on the assigned severity. You assign the severity of the issue when you open the case. With your agreement, the support team adjusts the assigned severity if an incorrect severity level is selected. For more information about Support plans, see [Basic, Advanced, and Premium Support plans](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-support-plans).

The following table lists some common examples of support issues, suggested severity levels, and the initial response time objectives. The initial response time objectives are used to describe IBM goals only, and don't represent a performance guarantee.

Initial response Service Level Objectives (SLO) do not apply to any sales related inquiries or cases.

| Severity level | Definition | Details |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| Severity 4 | Minimal business impact. | An inquiry or non-technical request. |
| Severity 3 | Minor business impact. | A service feature or function is usable, but has some problems that affect its use. No critical impact on operations is caused. |
| Severity 2 | Significant business impact. | A service feature or function is severely restricted in its use or you are in danger of missing business deadlines. |
| Severity 1 | Critical business impact or service is down. | Business-critical function is inoperable or critical interface is failed. This severity usually applies to a production environment and indicates that an inability to access services is leading to a critical impact on operations. This condition requires an immediate solution. |
