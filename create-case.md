# Creating support cases 
{: #open-case}

If you experience problems with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you can use support cases to get help with technical, access (IAM), billing & usage, and invoice or sales inquiry issues. You can create and manage a support case by using the [Support Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}. After you submit a support case, the support team investigates the issue based on your type of [support plan](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-support-plans).
{:shortdesc}

The types of available support depends on the support level of the account. Your support plan also determines the severity level that you can assign to support cases. For more information, see [Case severity and response time](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-support-case-severity#support-case-severity). 

By default, account users don't have access to create, update, search, or view cases. The account owner must provide users access by assigning an Identity and Access Management (IAM) access policy. For more information, see [Assigning user access for working with support cases](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-access#access).
{:tip}

All accounts can open a support case, but Lite accounts are unable to open technical support cases. Technical support for Lite accounts with FREE support is provided by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} docs and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-cloud?tab=Newest){: external}. 

Complete the following steps to create a support case: 

  1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Support** from the console menu bar.
  1. From the Contact support section, click **Create a case**. 
  1. Select the type of issue that you need help with. 
  1. Complete the required fields.
  1. Optional: 
    * Attach files and resources to provide more details about the issue you're experiencing.
    * Add another user to the case if the user is in the account. For more information, see [Adding users to your case management access group](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-access#add-user-access-group).
    * Select **Email me updates about this case** to receive support case notifications. 
  1. Click **Continue to review**, then **Create case**. You will receive email verification for the case. Follow the instructions for further communication on the issue. 

You can also create a support case by clicking **View all** from the Recent support cases widget of the Support Center. Then, from the Manage cases page, click **Create new case**.
