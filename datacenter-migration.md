# Data center closures in 2020
{: #dc-migrate}

As part of the data center modernization strategy for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, older legacy data centers in Dallas and Houston (D2, D6, D7, H2) were scheduled to close on 31 August 2020. These data center closures are now extended to 30 October 2020. Through coordination with our vendors, we secured an extension for select facilities in Dallas, Melbourne and Seattle. For DAL07, MEL01, and SEA01, data center closures are extended to 30 November 2020.

New products and services can't be provisioned on data centers that are scheduled to be closed.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} invests significantly in data center infrastructure. These investments include rolling out newer data centers and multizone regions (MZRs) designed to deliver a more resilient architecture with higher levels of network throughput and redundancy. For more information, see [Locations for resource deployment](/docs/overview?topic=overview-locations).

Part of this modernization strategy is to close older data centers that are unsuitable for upgrading. As this transition approaches, help is available to assist you in your migration to modern data centers. For more information, see [Migrating resources to a different data center](/docs/account?topic=account-migrate-data-center) or [FAQs for migrating resources to a different data center](/docs/account?topic=account-faqs-dc-closure).

The following table shows the locations with the associated data centers that are set to close, and the recommended data centers to which you can migrate.  

| Location      | Data Center to Close |  Migration Options  |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Dallas        | DAL07 | DAL10, DAL12, DAL13 | 
| Melbourne     | MEL01 | SYD01, SYD04, SYD05 |
