# FAQs

## How do I check for planned maintenance?
{: #planned_maintenance_gs}

1. On the [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/), select **View events** from the Planned maintenance widget. 
2. Go directly to the [Status - Planned maintenance ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=maintenance){: new_window} page.

## How do I escalate support cases? 
{: #escalate_support}
{: faq}

As an IBM Cloud customer, you can escalate support cases to surface critical issues. Once a case is escalated, the IBM Cloud support team reviews the information and responds with updates. 

To escalate a support case, complete the following steps: 
1. Contact IBM Cloud Support by phone or chat:
    * By phone at the following number: +1-866-403-7638.
    * By chat from the [Support Center ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: new_window}.
2. Provide your existing case number and request to escalate the case. 
3. Provide the justification for escalation and the business impact of your problem or issue. 

## How do I change my email preferences for notifications? 
{: #email_preferences_gs}
{: faq}

Are you receiving too many emails from us? You can change which email notifications you receive for planned events, unplanned events, and announcements in your profile settings. To change your email preferences, choose one of the following options: 

1. Go to [Notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/user/notifications) in your profile settings.
1. Select whether to receive email notifications for each type of event.

For `control.softlayer.com`, you can change your email preferences by going to **Account** > **Users** > **Email Preferences**. 

## What access is needed to work with support cases? 
{: #access_supportcases}
{: faq}

By default, users in your account don't have access to create, update, search, or view cases. As the account owner, you must provide users access by assigning an Identity and Access Management (IAM) access policy. 

When you create a case, you can give other users full access to that case by adding their email on the **Add another person to this case** field. Any added users have access to view, edit, and update only that case in the account. They also receive notifications when the case is updated. 

For classic infrastructure users, the permissions to assign support case access is now available in [migrated classic infrastructure permission access groups](/docs/iam?topic=iam-predefined).
