## How am I charged for support? 
{: #support-costs}
{: faq}

If you have Advanced or Premium support, you can track your monthly support costs by going to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Support costs**. Each support plan has a minimum monthly price for providing support for your cloud workload at the stated service level. Beyond this starting price, any additional costs for support are based on your resource usage. The higher your resource usage, the higher your total support cost. 

To view your support costs, you need an access policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service. For more information about access roles, see [IAM access](/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles).
