# How the customer support process works
{: #gs_supoverview}

All {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} customers are provided with free technical support through communities and blogs. The types of support that are available, and when they are available, depend on the support level of the account.
{:shortdesc}

You can access the support options, such as the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} community or Stack Overflow for technical issues, from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console Support Center.

You can use the Support Center to access your support options. For more information, see [Using the Support Center](/docs/get-support/howtogetsupport.html#using-avatar). The level of support plan you selected for your account determines the level of support available to you and the severity you can assign to support tickets when you contact customer support. For more information, see [How are tickets assigned and weighted?](/docs/get-support/ticketweight.html#support-ticket-severity)
