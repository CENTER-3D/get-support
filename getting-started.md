# Getting started tutorial
{: #getting-started}

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of checking the status of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} platform, services, and runtimes, as well as searching for information, subscribing to notifications, and using the troubleshooting information.
{:shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #prereqs}

Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console with your IBMid credentials.

If you are an {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure customer, you do not have an IBMid, and your SoftLayer account is not linked to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, see [Getting support for IBM Cloud infrastructure](/docs/customer-portal/cpsupport.html#customerportal_support) for more information.
{: tip}

## Step 1: Check the status
{: #check-status}

If you are experiencing issues with the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, check the Status page to determine if there are any issues that are affecting the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform and major services.

To view the status of the platform, services and runtimes, use the following steps:
  1. Click **Support** > **Status** from the menu bar.  
  2. To search for a specific issue, enter key words of your issue in the search bar.
  3. To see Status, click **Status** and then either select **All** to see the status of all components or **Issues** to see only the components that are reporting issues.
  4. To see notifications, click **Notifications** and then select if you want to see specific **Incidents**, **Security** notifications, **Maintenance**, or general **Announcements**.

See [Viewing IBM Cloud status and notifications](/docs/get-support/ViewStatus.html#viewing-bluemix-status) for more information about using the Status page.

## Step 2: Search for answers and ask questions
{: #search-ask}

You can use the Support Center to search the documentation and Stack Overflow or developerWorks (dW) Answers forums for answers. To search for answers, use the following steps:
  1. Click **Support** > **Support Center** from the menu bar.
  2. To search for answers to technical questions from IBM Cloud documentation and Stack overflow, enter your search text in the search bar.
  3. To search for answers to non-technical questions, under the **Community forums** section, click **IBM developerWorks Answers**.

You can also ask questions on the Stack overflow dW Answers and sites.  For more information, see [Asking a question](/docs/get-support/howtogetsupport.html#asking-a-question).

## Step 3: Contact customer support
{: #contact-customer-support}

If you have an issue that does not have a cause listed on the Status page and you are unable to find an answer by searching the documentation, community pages and forums, you can open a ticket to contact customer support.

To open a ticket from the Support Center, use the following steps:
  1. Click **Support** and select **Support Center** from the menu bar.
  2. From the **Get help** section, click **Open a ticket**.
  3. Complete the required information and click **Submit**.

For information about more ways to contact support, see [Opening a support ticket](/docs/get-support/howtogetsupport.html#open-ticket).

## Step 4: Set up notifications
{: #view-notifications}

To get notified about announcements or maintenance that affects the platform, you can subscribe to  emailed notifications. When you create an account or you're added to an account, you are unsubscribed to notifications by default.

To subscribe to notifications, access the Platform Notifications page and select the type of notification to receive:
  1. Select **Manage** > **Account** > **Platform Notifications** from the menu bar.
  2. Click to turn on **Announcements** or **Planned maintenance**.
  3. Select **Save**.
