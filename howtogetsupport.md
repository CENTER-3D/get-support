## Requesting support for resources in the European Union
{: #eusupported}

European Union (EU) support is available to customers who choose to enable the EU supported setting. EU Support is provided 24 hours a day and 7 days a week by engineers that are located in Europe. Global teams provide support at the discretion of the EU support team. Global teams might be contacted, for example, when issues are not resolved by the Advanced Customer Support (ACS) team in the EU, and more expertise is needed.

You can specify that you want EU support for your account if the following criteria are true:

* The EU Supported setting is enabled for your account by the master user or account owner. For more information, see [Enabling the EU Supported setting](/docs/account?topic=account-eu-hipaa-supported#bill_eusupported).
* Your resources are in the appropriate European data center. For more information, see [Data centers](/docs/overview?topic=overview-locations#data-centers).
* You select the EU supported case level when you open the case.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform services that are hosted in the Frankfurt location must be supported by a team that is physically located in Europe. 
{: note}  

Enabling the EU Support setting for your account applies to all future cases that you open for issues on any service or data center that is hosted in the EU region. However, if you add resources outside of an EU data center or Frankfurt location, issues for those resources are not necessarily handled by a support team in Europe. Any cases that are opened before you enable the EU Supported setting aren't affected.
