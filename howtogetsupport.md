# How do I get the support I need?
{: #getting-customer-support}

If you experience problems with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you have several options to get help with determining the cause of the problem and finding a solution.
{:shortdesc}

If your account was created from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console or if your SoftLayer account was created from the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure customer portal and it is a linked account, you can open support tickets from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. Linked accounts are linked between {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure services. See [Linking IBMid user accounts](/docs/admin/softlayerlink.html#link_user_accounts) for more information.

If your account is a SoftLayer account that was created in the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure customer portal and is not a linked account, see [Getting support for {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure](/docs/customer-portal/cpsupport.html#customerportal_support) for more information about opening support tickets from the customer portal.

## Using the Support Center
{: #using-avatar}

To access the Support Center, log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. On the menu bar, click **Support** and select **Support Center**.  

You can use the Support Center search field to find answers to your questions from across the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} documentation and Stack Overflow forum. You can also manage support tickets from the Support Center. You can find links to both the Stack Overflow forum for technical questions and the developerWorks (dw answers) forum for all other questions under the Forums section of the Support Center.  

Depending on the type of account you have, other options are also available from the Support Center.  
* If you have a [premium](/docs/get-support/getstarttssup.html#premium-support) or  [advanced](/docs/get-support/getstarttssup.html#standard-support) support account, you can find call-in numbers to get help.
* If your account was created in the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure customer portal and it is linked between PaaS and IaaS services, you can also access the **Call US** and **Chat Now** options to call support or to start a chat session.

The Support Center is the preferred method for obtaining support, but if you cannot log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you can use the [Get Help](http://www.ibm.biz/bluemixsupport){: new_window} page to submit a ticket.

### Asking a question
{: #asking-a-question}

The Stack Overflow forum, for technical questions, and the dW Answers forum, for general questions, both provide a wide variety of searchable answers to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} questions. If you don't find an existing answer, ask a new question. You can access Stack Overflow and dW Answers from the Support Center, or use the following links:

  * Go to [Stack Overflow ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-bluemix){: new_window} to ask technical questions about developing apps with the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform and services.
  * Go to [dW Answers ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smart-spaces/12/bluemix.html){: new_window} to ask general questions about the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} offering and about getting started instructions.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} development and support teams actively monitor Stack Overflow and dW Answers, and follow the questions that are tagged with **ibm-cloud**. When you create a question in either forum, add the **ibm-cloud** tag to your question to ensure that it is seen by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} development and support teams.

If the problem is not due to an outage, and if you can't find an answer for your specific problem, you can contact customer support by opening a support ticket.

## Opening a support ticket
{: #open-ticket}

If you have a valid {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account, there are several ways that you can open a support ticket to get help with a general technical issue or with an account issue.

When you open a support ticket, ensure that you indicate an appropriate severity for your ticket. The severity determines how your ticket is handled. See [Support ticket severity and response time](/docs/get-support/ticketweight.html#support-ticket-severity) for information about the different severities.

If your support inquiry requires a more immediate response, consider upgrading to the premium or advanced support tier so that you can open severity 1-4 support tickets. To upgrade your account to a higher support level, contact your [IBM sales representative ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} or email sales@bluemix.net.

## Requesting support for resources in the European Union
{: #eusupported}

European Union (EU) support is provided 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by engineers located in Europe for customers who have selected the EU supported option. Global teams provide additional support only at the discretion and under the direction of the EU support team. Global teams might be contacted, for example, when issues are not resolved by the Level 1 or Level 2 support team in the EU, and expertise is needed from a global Level 3 support team member.

You can specify that you want support for your account from the support team that is physically located in Europe if the following criteria are true:
  * Your master user or account owner set the EU Supported option for your account
  * Your resources are in the appropriate European data center
  * You select the **EU supported** ticket level when you open the ticket

For {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform, only services hosted in the Germany region can be supported by a team that is physically located in Europe.  

Setting the **EU Supported** option for your account applies to all future tickets that you open for issues on any service or data center hosted in the EU region. Any tickets you opened prior to setting this option are not affected. If you set this option and you add resources outside of an EU data center or the Germany region, issues for those resources are not necessarily handled by a support team in Europe.

You can set the **EU Supported** option for your account from the Billing window of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. See [Enabling the EU supported option](/docs/pricing/eusupported.html#bill_eusupported) for more information.

If you are an {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} infrastructure customer and you do not have a linked account, you can set the **EU Supported** option from the Account Profile window of the customer portal. See [Setting the EU Supported option](/docs/customer-portal/cpmanuserprof.html#cp_seteusupported) for more information.

### EU Supported services
{: #eusupportedservices}

After setting the **EU Supported** option, you can also take advantage of additional controls to support and operate {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} from the European Union. All plans, except lite plans, for the following services are hosted in Europe and available as EU supported:

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure services in the following categories:
  * Compute
  * Storage
  * Network
  * Containers

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform services in the following categories (Germany region only):

3. Provide details of the potential security vulnerability by including one of the following items:
