# Managing tickets
{: #check-ticket-status}

All client support issues are documented in support tickets. Each support ticket is assigned a unique ticket number for reference and a severity level based on the details in the ticket description. You can use the ticket number to review your support ticket progress and update the support ticket.

To view and begin to manage your support tickets, use the following steps:
  1. Click **Support** > **View Tickets** from the menu bar.
  2. To view a listing of open tickets, to see the current status or update a ticket, click **Open**.
  3. To view a listing of previous tickets, to see help that was provided in a previous ticket for example, click **Closed**.

Updates to your tickets and responses are sent to you by email and recorded in the ticket notes.
