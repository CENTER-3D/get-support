# Escalating support cases
{: #escalation}

You can use the escalation process to surface critical issues and voice your concern if a support ticket isn't being addressed appropriately. When a case is escalated, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support team reviews the information in the support case and responds with appropriate updates.

 To escalate a case, complete the following steps:

1. Contact {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support by phone or chat:
  * By phone at +1-(866)403-7638.
  * By chat from the [Support Center](https://{DomainName}/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.
1. Provide your existing case number and request to escalate the case.
1. Provide the justification for escalation and the business impact of your problem or issue.


## Case severity and initial response times
{: #support-case-severity}

How quickly your support cases are addressed depends on the assigned severity. You assign the severity of the issue when you open the case. With your agreement, the support team adjusts the assigned severity if an incorrect severity level is selected.

The following table lists some common examples of support issues, suggested severity levels, and the initial response time objectives. The initial response time objectives are used to describe IBM goals only, and don't represent a performance guarantee.

| Severity   | Severity Definition | Initial Response Time Objectives |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Severity 1 | **Critical business impact or service is down.** <br> Business-critical function is inoperable or critical interface is failed. This severity usually applies to a production environment and indicates that an inability to access services is leading to a critical impact on operations. This condition requires an immediate solution. | Premium: Less than 15 minutes <br> Advanced: Within 1 hour <br> Basic: N/A, can't open severity 1 cases |
| Severity 2 | **Significant business impact.** <br> A service feature or function is severely restricted in its use or you are in danger of missing business deadlines. | Premium: Within 1 hour <br> Advanced: Within 2 hours <br> Basic: N/A, can't open severity 2 cases |
| Severity 3 | **Minor business impact.** <br> A service feature or function is usable, but has some problems that affect its use. No critical impact on operations is caused. | Premium: Within 2 hours <br> Advanced: Within 4 hours <br> Basic: N/A, can't open severity 3 cases |
| Severity 4 | **Minimal business impact.** <br> An inquiry or non-technical request. | Premium: Within 4 hours <br> Advanced: Within 8 hours <br> Basic: No SLO |

If your support inquiry requires a more immediate response, consider upgrading to the premium or advanced support plan so that you can open severity 1-4 support cases. To upgrade your support plan, contact your [IBM sales representative](https://www.ibm.com/contact/us/en/?lnk=flg-cont-usen){: external}.
