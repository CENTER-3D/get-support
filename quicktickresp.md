# How do I get a quick response to my ticket?
{: #quicktickresp}

When you contact support and open a support ticket, you can request a specific severity level, depending on the type and urgency of the problem. The severity level can affect how quickly your issue is addressed.
{:shortdesc}

You define the severity of the issue based on your business needs and your level of support. For more information about levels of support plans, see [Support plans](/docs/get-support/index.html). All tickets are investigated to identify and resolve the root cause of the issue. When the support team needs problem diagnostic data to determine the root cause of the issue, you are asked for approval to access log files and other problem determination data from your application. Without this data, the resolution of your issue might be delayed.

## Collecting diagnostic information
{: #collecting-diagnostic-information}

To diagnose and resolve problems with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} applications and services, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support team might ask for diagnostic information. Use the following instructions to gather and provide the requested information as quickly as possible.

Before you collect diagnostic information, complete the following steps:

1. Ensure that you have the most current version of the Cloud Foundry command line interface installed. For more information, see [Installing the Cloud Foundry command line interface](/docs/starters/install_cli.html).
>**Note:** If you do not have the most current version, after the Cloud Foundry command line is connected to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, the `cf logs` command might not return output.
2. Ensure that you connected the Cloud Foundry command line interface to where {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is running by using the `cf api` command.

Use one of the following scripts to collect diagnostic information:

  * For Windows operating systems, download the [bmdiag-general.bat ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://bluemix-mustgather.mybluemix.net/mustgather/general/bmdiag-general.bat){: new_window} file and run it.
  * For Linux and Mac operating systems, download the [bmdiag-general.sh ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://bluemix-mustgather.mybluemix.net/mustgather/general/bmdiag-general.sh){: new_window} file and run it.

The scripts use the Cloud Foundry command line interface to extract the following information from your application environment:
  * Application logs
  * Application metadata
  * Configured routes
  * Events
  * Provisioned services

## Escalating support cases
{: #escalation}

Use the escalation process to surface critical issues or if you feel your support case isnâ€™t being addressed properly. When a case is escalated, the manager on duty reviews the information in the support case, engages the appropriate members of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support technical team, and provides you with appropriate updates.

You can request further assistance by escalating your case to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support Manager on duty as a customer with any paid subscription. 

To escalate a support case, you must have an open support case for the issue. Also, ensure that you provided a detailed description of the technical issue in the support case that you opened.

 To escalate a case, complete the following steps:

  1. Contact the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support Team by phone or chat:
    * By phone at the following number: 866-403-7638.
    * By chat from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [Support Center ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: new_window}.
  2. Provide your existing case number and request to escalate the case.
  3. Provide the justification for escalation and the business impact of your case.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support Managers are on duty and available 24 hours a day, every day of the week. The managers on duty engage the appropriate resources to address your case and then inform you about the actions taken.
