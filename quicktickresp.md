# How do I get a quick response to my ticket?
{: #quicktickresp}

When you contact support and open a support ticket, you can request a specific severity level, depending on the type and urgency of the problem. The severity level can affect how quickly your issue is addressed.
{:shortdesc}

You define the severity of the issue based on your business needs and your level of support. See [Support plans](/docs/get-support/index.html) for more information about levels of support plans. All tickets are investigated to identify and resolve the root cause of the issue. When problem diagnostic data is needed to determine the root cause of the issue, you are asked for approval to access log files and other problem determination data from your application. Without this data, the resolution of your issue might be delayed.

## Collecting diagnostic information
{: #collecting-diagnostic-information}

To diagnose and resolve problems with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} applications and services, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support team might ask you to collect diagnostic information. Use the following instructions to gather and provide the requested information as quickly as possible.

Before you collect diagnostic information, complete the following steps:

1. Ensure that you have installed the latest cf command line interface. For more information, see [Installing the cf command line interface](/docs/starters/install_cli.html).
>**Note:** If you do not have the latest cf command line interface installed, after the cf command line is connected to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, the `cf logs` command might not return output.
2. Ensure that you connected the cf command line interface to where {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is running by using the `cf api` command.

Use one of the following scripts to collect diagnostic information:

  * For Windows operating systems, download the [bmdiag-general.bat ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://bluemix-mustgather.mybluemix.net/mustgather/general/bmdiag-general.bat){: new_window} file and run it.
  * For Linux and Mac operating systems, download the [bmdiag-general.sh ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://bluemix-mustgather.mybluemix.net/mustgather/general/bmdiag-general.sh){: new_window} file and run it.

The scripts use the cf command line interface to extract the following information from your application environment:
  * Application logs
  * Application metadata
  * Configured routes
  * Events
  * Provisioned services
