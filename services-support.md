## {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} beta service
{: #s-services-betaorcont}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} releases services or container images that are classified as beta releases. These services are in a trial stage of development and they aren't production-ready. A beta release helps {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} development and marketing teams to assess the value of the service in the market. This assessment enables teams to make changes before it's released as a GA service or container image.

If the root cause analysis determines the issue is a defect in the beta service or container image, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} isn't required to provide a fix. Additionally, the case is assigned the appropriate 3 or 4 severity level.
