# Support options for your offering type
{: #support-different-services}

You can use the Support Center to access your available support options. The support option that you receive is different based on the type of service you have. 
{:shortdesc}

## {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} generally available service
{: #s-services-gaorcont}

For services or container images that are provided by {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} and are generally available, support is provided for problems that are determined to be a defect.

If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in the IBM generally available service or container image, the case is addressed based on the severity that you assign.

## IBM Beta service
{: #s-services-betaorcont}

IBM releases services or container images that are classified as Beta releases. These services are in a trial stage of development and they aren't production-ready. A Beta release helps IBM development and marketing teams to assess the value of the service in the market. This assessment enables the teams to make changes before it's released as a generally available service or container image.

If the root cause analysis determines the issue is a defect in the IBM Beta service or container image, then IBM isn't required to provide a fix. Additionally, the case is assigned the appropriate 3 or 4 severity level.

## IBM experimental service
{: #s-services-exporcont}

IBM releases services or container images that are classified as experimental, which you can try out. To view all available experimental services, boilerplates, and runtimes, log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. Then, click **Catalog**, scroll to the end of the catalog, and click **{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Experimental Services**. These services might be unstable, change frequently in ways that aren't compatible with earlier versions, and might be discontinued with a short notice. These services aren't recommended for use in production environments.

You can get community assistance for technical issues for experimental services through [Stack Overflow ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-cloud?tab=Newest){: new_window} and other issues through [Developer Answers ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/ibm-cloud.html){: new_window}. If a problem is a defect in an experimental service, IBM isn't required to provide a fix.

## Third-party service
{: #s-services-3p}

Third-party services are provided by vendors outside of IBM. These services are provided by individual software entities, IBM Business Partners, or independent software vendors (ISV).

Support for third-party services is provided by the service provider. If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in a third-party service, IBM isn't required to provide a fix. However, IBM shares analysis with the third-party service provider, if needed, and can work through Marketplace with the third-party service to help solve the issue.

## Open source or community service
{: #s-services-osorcomserv}

Open source or community services are provided by open source communities outside of IBM.

If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in an open source or community service, IBM isn't required to provide a fix. IBM closes the case and refers you to the community or forum for assistance. You can get community assistance for technical issues through [Stack Overflow ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-cloud){: new_window} and other issues through [Developer Answers ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/ibm-cloud/){: new_window}.
