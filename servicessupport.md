# How do I get support for services?
{: #support-different-services}

When you request support, a root cause analysis is completed. The support team responds based on the root cause, the severity you assigned the issue, and on the type of service as described in the following sections:

## IBM generally available service or container image
{: #s-services-gaorcont}

If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in the IBM generally available service or container image, the ticket is addressed based on the severity that you assign.

## IBM Beta service or container image
{: #s-services-betaorcont}

IBM will release services or container images that are classified as a Beta release. A Beta release helps IBM development and marketing teams assess the value of the service in the market. As a result, they can make adjustments before potentially releasing it as a generally available service or container image. If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in the IBM Beta service or container image, then IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. Additionally, the ticket is assigned a severity 3 or 4 as appropriate.

## IBM experimental service or container image
{: #s-services-exporcont}

IBM will release services or container images that are classified as experimental. These services might be unstable, change frequently, and might be discontinued with a short notice. For services that are classified as experimental, you can obtain community assistance for technical issues through [Stack Overflow ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-bluemix){: new_window} and other issues through [dW Answers ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smart-spaces/12/bluemix.html){: new_window}.

## Third-party service
{: #s-services-3p}

Third-party services are provided by vendors outside of IBM. These services are provided by individual software entities, partners, or independent software vendors (ISV). If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in a third-party service, then IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. However, IBM will work through our Marketplace with the third-party service and our client to help solve the issue.

## Open source or community service
{: #s-services-osorcomserv}

Open source or community services are provided by open source communities outside of IBM. If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in an open source or community service, then IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. IBM will close the ticket and refer you to the community or forum for assistance.
