# How do I get support for services?
{: #support-different-services}

When you request support, a root cause analysis is completed. The support team responds based on the root cause, the severity you assigned the issue, and on the type of service.
{:shortdesc}

For more information about ticket severity, see [How are tickets assigned and weighted?](/docs/get-support/ticketweight.html#support-ticket-severity){: new_window}

## IBM generally available service
{: #s-services-gaorcont}

For services or container images that are provided by IBM and are generally available, support is provided for problems that are determined to be a defect.

If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in the IBM generally available service or container image, the ticket is addressed based on the severity that you assign.

## IBM Beta service
{: #s-services-betaorcont}

IBM releases services or container images that are classified as Beta releases. These services are in a trial stage of development and they are not production-ready. A Beta release helps IBM development and marketing teams to assess the value of the service in the market and make adjustments before potentially releasing it as a generally available service or container image.

If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in the IBM Beta service or container image, then IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. Additionally, the ticket is assigned a severity 3 or 4 as appropriate.

## IBM experimental service
{: #s-services-exporcont}

IBM releases services or container images that are classified as experimental which you can try out. To view all available experimental services, boilerplates, and runtimes, log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, click **Catalog**, scroll to the end of the catalog, and then click **{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Experimental Services**. These services might be unstable, change frequently in ways that are not compatible with earlier versions, and might be discontinued with a short notice. These services are not recommended for use in production environments.

You can obtain community assistance for technical issues For services that are classified as experimental through [Stack Overflow ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-bluemix){: new_window} and other issues through [dW Answers ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smart-spaces/12/bluemix.html){: new_window}. If a problem is investigated by IBM and the problem is determined to be a defect in an experimental service, IBM is not obligated to provide a fix.

## Third-party service
{: #s-services-3p}

Third-party services are provided by vendors outside of IBM. These services are provided by individual software entities, partners, or independent software vendors (ISV).

Support for third-party services is provided by the service provider. If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in a third-party service, IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. However, IBM shares analysis with the third-party service provider, if needed, and can work through Marketplace with the third-party service to help solve the issue.

## Open source or community service
{: #s-services-osorcomserv}

Open source or community services are provided by open source communities outside of IBM.

If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in an open source or community service, IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. IBM closes the ticket and refers you to the community or forum for assistance. You can obtain community assistance for technical issues through [Stack Overflow ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-bluemix){: new_window} and other issues through [dW Answers ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smart-spaces/12/bluemix.html){: new_window}.
