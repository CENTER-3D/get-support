# How do I get support for services?
{: #support-different-services}

When you request support, a root cause analysis is completed. The support team responds based on the root cause, the severity you assigned the issue, and on the type of service.
{:shortdesc}

For more information about ticket severity, see [How are tickets assigned and weighted?](/docs/get-support/ticketweight.html#support-ticket-severity){: new_window}

## IBM generally available service
{: #s-services-gaorcont}

For services or container images that are provided by IBM and are generally available, support is provided for problems that are determined to be a defect.

If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in the IBM generally available service or container image, the ticket is addressed based on the severity that you assign.

## IBM Beta service
{: #s-services-betaorcont}

IBM releases services or container images that are classified as Beta releases. These services are in a trial stage of development and they are not production-ready. A Beta release helps IBM development and marketing teams to assess the value of the service in the market. This assessment enables the teams to make adjustments before it is released as a generally available service or container image.

If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in the IBM Beta service or container image, then IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. Additionally, the ticket is assigned the appropriate 3 or 4 severity level.

## IBM experimental service
{: #s-services-exporcont}

IBM releases services or container images that are classified as experimental, which you can try out. To view all available experimental services, boilerplates, and runtimes, log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.  Then, click **Catalog**, scroll to the end of the catalog, and click **{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Experimental Services**. These services might be unstable, change frequently in ways that are not compatible with earlier versions, and might be discontinued with a short notice. These services are not recommended for use in production environments.

You can obtain community assistance for technical issues for experimental services through [Stack Overflow ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-bluemix){: new_window} and other issues through [dW Answers ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smart-spaces/12/bluemix.html){: new_window}. If a problem is a defect in an experimental service, IBM is not obligated to provide a fix.

## Third-party service
{: #s-services-3p}

Third-party services are provided by vendors outside of IBM. These services are provided by individual software entities, IBM Business Partners, or independent software vendors (ISV).

Support for third-party services is provided by the service provider. If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in a third-party service, IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. However, IBM shares analysis with the third-party service provider, if needed, and can work through Marketplace with the third-party service to help solve the issue.

## Open source or community service
{: #s-services-osorcomserv}

Open source or community services are provided by open source communities outside of IBM.

If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in an open source or community service, IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. IBM closes the ticket and refers you to the community or forum for assistance. You can obtain community assistance for technical issues through [Stack Overflow ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-bluemix){: new_window} and other issues through [dW Answers ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smart-spaces/12/bluemix.html){: new_window}.
