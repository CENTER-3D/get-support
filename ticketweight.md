# How are tickets assigned and weighted?
{: #support-ticket-severity}

How quickly your support tickets are addressed depends on the weight that is assigned to each ticket by the severity of the issue. You assign the severity of the issue when you open the ticket. For more information about the severity levels that are available for your account type, see [Support plans](/docs/get-support/index.html).
{:shortdesc}

The following table lists some common examples of support issues, suggested severity levels, and the response time objectives. The response time objectives are used to describe IBM goals only, and do not represent a performance guarantee.

| Severity | Severity Definition | Response Time Objectives |
|-----|------- | ----- |
| Severity 1 | <strong>Critical business impact or service is down.</strong> <br> Business critical function is inoperable or critical interface is failed. This severity usually applies to a production environment and indicates that an inability to access services is leading to a critical impact on operations. This condition requires an immediate solution. | Premium: Less than 15 minutes <br> Advanced: Within 1 hour <br> Basic: N/A, can't open severity 1 cases |
| Severity 2 | <strong>Significant business impact.</strong> <br> A service feature or function is severely restricted in its use or you are in danger of missing business deadlines. | Premium: Within 1 hour <br> Advanced: Within 2 hours <br> Basic: N/A, can't open severity 2 cases |
| Severity 3 | <strong>Minor business impact.</strong> <br> A service feature or function is usable, but has some problems that affect its use. No critical impact on operations is caused. | Premium: Within 2 hours <br> Advanced: Within 4 hours <br> Basic: N/A, can't open severity 3 cases |
| Severity 4 | <strong>Minimal business impact.</strong> <br> An inquiry or non-technical request. | Premium: Within 4 hours <br> Advanced: Within 8 hours <br> Basic: Best effort |
