# Tracking your support costs
{: #support-tracking-costs}

**WIP** 

**Need intro text**

Advanced and Premium support plans have a starting price for your cloud workload at the stated service level. This starting price includes support for a certain amount of resource usage. If your resource usage exceeds this amount, you're charged for the associated extra support costs. You can track your support costs from the **Manage > Billing and usage > Support costs** page. For more information, see [Viewing your support costs](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-support).
