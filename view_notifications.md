# Viewing notifications
{: #viewing-notifications}

The [Notifications page](https://cloud.ibm.com/notifications){: external} is a centralized place to view and control all incidents, maintenance, and announcements. Unlike the [Status page](https://cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=maintenance){: external} that provides information about all of the events that affect the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} platform, the Notifications page filters events that are likely to affect your account.
{:shortdesc}

Pages specific to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} classic infrastructure are deprecated. The new Notifications page hosts all classic infrastructure notifications. You can view classic infrastructure history for planned and unplanned incidents and announcements on the Notifications page. 
{: note}

To find the Notifications page, log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console and click the **Notifications** icon ![Notification icon](../icons/Notification.svg) on the menu bar. Or, you can access the page directly at [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} - Notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/notifications){: external}.

The new unified notification experience provides enhancements to how users are notified about important changes on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform: 

* The **Notification** icon ![Bell icon](../icons/Notification.svg) on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console shows a red indicator that is only visible when a new notification is available. You can see the details and interact with new and archived notifications.

* The Notifications page is account scoped and shows only notifications for the account that is selected on the menu bar. You can switch accounts to view notifications that are affecting a different account. 

* The severity or impact is listed for each notification type. Depending on the notification, you might see severity 1 listed for an unplanned incident notification and high impact that is listed for a planned maintenance notification. 

* You can use the search field to locate a specific notification or filter by a notification type. 

* Navigate to a specific notification by using the unique URL that is associated with each notification. You can save and share the URL with users in the account. 

* You can launch the notifications page with the applied filters to see only applicable notifications. Make sure to save the URL to launch the Notifications page with the filters youâ€™d like to see applied.

## Getting advanced notice for disruptive maintenance
{: #disruptive-maintenance}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} tries to limit disruptive, required maintenance for Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings. Most maintenance is done in a non-disruptive manner to avoid the impact to your business, but when disruptive maintenance is necessary, we provide as much advanced notice as possible. 

The following table shows the required advanced notice for PaaS offerings. 

| Type           | Advanced Notice Guidelines |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Non-disruptive | no notification guidelines |                  
| Disruptive     | 7 days                     | 
| Emergency      | 24 hours                   | 
{: caption="Table 2. Advanced notice guidelines for PaaS offerings" caption-side="top"}

For IaaS offerings, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} provides advanced notice that's dependent on the severity of the impact. The following table defines the types and levels of the possibility of an impact. 

| Possibility of impact | Definition |
|-----------------------|------------|
| High            | Certain, likely, or has the potential to cause an extended. <br> Certain brief disruption, partial extended disruption, or a moderate to high possibility of a brief disruption. |
| Medium          | Low to moderate possibility of a brief disruption. |
| Low             | None to negligible chance of a disruption or routine change. <br> No assumed risk or a disruption that is isolated to a single customer. |
