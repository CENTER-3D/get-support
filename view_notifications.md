# Viewing notifications
{: #viewing-notifications}

The [Notifications page](https://cloud.ibm.com/notifications){: external} is a centralized place to view and control all incidents, maintenance, and announcements. Unlike the [Status page](https://cloud.ibm.com/status?selected=maintenance){: external} that provides information about all of the events that affect the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform, the Notifications page filters events that are likely to affect your account.
{:shortdesc}

Pages specific to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} classic infrastructure are deprecated. The new Notifications page hosts all classic infrastructure notifications. You can view classic infrastructure history for planned and unplanned incidents and announcements on the Notifications page. 
{: note}

To find the Notifications page, log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console and click the **Notifications** icon ![Notification icon](../icons/Notification.svg) on the menu bar. Or, you can access the page directly at [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} - Notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/notifications){: external}.

The new unified notification experience provides enhancements to how users are notified about important changes on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform: 

* The **Notification** icon ![Bell icon](../icons/Notification.svg) on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console shows a red indicator that is only visible when a new notification is available. You can see the details and interact with new and archived notifications.

* The Notifications page is account scoped and shows only notifications for the account that is selected on the menu bar. You can switch accounts to view notifications that are affecting a different account. 

* The severity or impact is listed for each notification type. Depending on the notification, you might see severity 1 listed for an unplanned incident notification and high impact that is listed for a planned maintenance notification. 

* You can use the search field to locate a specific notification or filter by a notification type. 

* Navigate to a specific notification by using the unique URL that is associated with each notification. You can save and share the URL with users in the account. 

* You can launch the notifications page with the applied filters to see only applicable notifications. Make sure to save the URL to launch the Notifications page with the filters youâ€™d like to see applied.
